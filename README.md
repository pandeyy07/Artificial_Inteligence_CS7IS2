Aim: Solve a Constraint Satisfaction problem using a variety of AI algorithms. 

The constraint satisfaction problem our group chose to solve is the Futoshiki logic puzzle. 

![Alt text](puzzleExample.png?raw=true)

The Algorithms we used to solve the puzzle iniclude Backtracking with and without value forward checking, AC-3 and Simulated Annealing. 

To run Backtracking without forward checking go to BacktrackSolver/futoshiki.py. Run the code and input one of the four text files. (four.txt, five.txt, six.txt, seven.txt). 

To run Backtracking with forward checking go to ForwardChecking/BacktrackingImproved.ipynb and run the code.

To run AC-3 go to AC-3/AC3_AI.ipynb and run the code. 

To run Simulated Annealing go to simulated_annealing/
